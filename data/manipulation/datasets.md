# Datasets

- [BridgeData V2](https://rail-berkeley.github.io/bridgedata/): A large and diverse dataset of robotic manipulation behaviors designed to facilitate research in scalable robot learning.
- [BC-Z](https://sites.google.com/view/bc-z/home): A large-scale VR-teleoperated dataset of demonstrations for 100 manipulation tasks, and train a convolutional neural network to imitate closed-loop actions from RGB pixel observations.
- [DROID](https://droid-dataset.github.io/): A diverse robot manipulation dataset with 76k demonstration trajectories or 350h of interaction data, collected across 564 scenes and 86 tasks by 50 data collectors in North America, Asia, and Europe over the course of 12 months.
- [MIME](https://sites.google.com/view/mimedataset):  The largest available robotic-demonstration dataset (MIME) that contains 8260 human-robot demonstrations over 20 different robotic tasks .
- [MimicGen](https://mimicgen.github.io/): A system for automatically synthesizing large-scale, rich datasets from only a small number of human demonstrations by adapting them to new contexts.
- [Open X-Embodiment Dataset](https://robotics-transformer-x.github.io/): The largest open-source real robot dataset to date. It contains 1M+ real robot trajectories spanning 22 robot embodiments, from single robot arms to bi-manual robots and quadrupeds.
- [Robo Turk](https://roboturk.stanford.edu/): A Crowdsourcing Platform for Robotic Skill Learning through Imitation.
- [RoboNet](https://www.robonet.wiki/): An open database for sharing robotic experience, which provides an initial pool of 15 million video frames, from 7 different robot platforms, and study how it can be used to learn generalizable models for vision-based robotic manipulation.
- [RoboSet](https://robopen.github.io/): Diverse multi-skill multi-task multi-modal dataset.
- [RH20T](https://rh20t.github.io/): A Comprehensive Robotic Dataset for Learning Diverse Skills in One-Shot.
- [RT-1](https://robotics-transformer1.github.io/): A large dataset of real-world robotic experiences that consists of over 130k episodes, which contain over 700 tasks, and was collected with a fleet of 13 robots over 17 months.
